# Architecture:

In our full stack project, we used a combination of frontend technologies, 
including Express HTML for server-side rendering and JavaScript for client-side 
interactivity. The centerpiece of our frontend was a Single Page Application 
(SPA) built with the Angular framework. This SPA approach allowed us to create 
a dynamic and responsive user interface, offering a seamless user experience 
by updating content without full page reloads. On the backend, we opted for a 
NoSQL MongoDB database primarily because of its flexibility and scalability. 
MongoDB's document-oriented structure suited our project's requirements, 
enabling us to store and retrieve data efficiently in a JSON-like format.

# Functionality:

JSON serves as a pivotal bridge between frontend 
and backend development. It is a lightweight data format that 
resembles JavaScript objects, making it easy for the frontend to consume data 
from the backend. JSON ensures a standardized way of transferring data, 
facilitating seamless communication between different parts of our application. 
Throughout the project, we frequently refactored code to enhance functionality 
and efficiency. Reusable UI components played a key role in this process, as 
they allowed us to eliminate redundancy and promote consistency in the user 
interface. This approach not only saved development time but also ensured a 
more maintainable codebase.

# Testing:

Testing in a full stack application involves various methods and considerations. 
We conducted API testing to ensure the correctness of endpoints by sending 
requests and verifying responses. Additionally, we had to address security concerns, 
such as authentication and authorization, to safeguard our application. 
This required a thorough understanding of securing endpoints and implementing 
secure data transmission through techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

# Reflection:

This course has been instrumental in advancing my understanig of Angular. I've 
acquired a deep understanding of the MEAN stack, enabling me to create robust 
full stack applications. I've honed skills in frontend development with Angular, 
backend development with Express and MongoDB, and the ability to seamlessly 
connect them through APIs and JSON. This knowledge has made me a more marketable 
candidate in my career field by equipping me with the skills and expertise 
to tackle complex web development projects, as well as the ability to work 
efficiently and collaboratively in a team environment.
